# WordPress API Libraries

## Matching Third Party APIs with WordPress Developers.

The goal of this project is to provide a full **Third Party API library** built with WordPress standards for all available APIs.

## Guidelines

* Use [WP Remote Request](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_remote_request/) or similar functions for API calls. No using curl or other methods directly for calls.
* PHP 7 Must be fully supported, support for older versions not required
* Error messages should be set with [WP Error](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Error)
* API Classes should not save any data to the DB
* All methods of the API should be supported
* More to come...
